### Step2:
Perform the data cleaning process to check whether the dataset contains any null values.
### Step3:
The Exploratory Data analysis is done in order to explore the relationships.
### Step4:
With the help of seaborn plot the various graphs for age distribution, fare distribution, and survival rate by class.
### Step5:
Then the relationship between the age, class and survival is plotted.
